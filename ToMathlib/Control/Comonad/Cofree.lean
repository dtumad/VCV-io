/-! # Cofree Comonads

This file defines the `Cofree` comonad, which is a comonad that is constructed from a functor and a
coalgebra.

Since this is a coinductive type, the only way to define it right now is to use the `M` type
construction from `PFunctor` (can we do this? it's only meant for a `PFunctor`, not an arbitrary
type mapping `f : Type u â†’ Type v`).
