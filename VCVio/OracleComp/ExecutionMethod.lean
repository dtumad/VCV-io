# Executing Monads as Probabalistic Computations

This file defines a structure `ExecutionMethod spec m` to provide a way to specify how to
run a monadic computation as a `ProbComp` (and in particular get probability distributions on
outputs of the computation).
Definitions like `SignatureAlg` extend this to allow them to be defined over arbitrary monads.
This means that definitions like "IND-CPA secure" are always *relative* to the execution method.

`ExecutionMethod.default` handles the case where `spec := probSpec`, in which case the
"execution function" is just `id`.
