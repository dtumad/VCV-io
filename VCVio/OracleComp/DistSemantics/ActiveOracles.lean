# Oracles Used by a Computation

This file defines a function `OracleComp.activeOracles` that
returns the set of oracle indices that can possibly be called by a computation.
Works by just traversing the entire possible execution space,
so this really shouldn't be used in practice.
However it can be useful in proving certain lemmas about existence of certain reductions.
