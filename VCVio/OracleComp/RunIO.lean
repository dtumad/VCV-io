# Executing Computations

This file defines a function `runIO` for executing a computation via the `IO` monad.

The semantics mirror `evalDist` in that the oracle will respond uniformly at random,
however we need to limit the oracle set to `unifSpec` to get computability of the function.
In particular we can't choose randomly from arbitrary types.
Usually it's possible to reduce to this anyway using `SelectableType` instances (see `unifOracle`).

NOTE: `OracleComp.failure` could instead be an error to allow error msg propogation.

Changing this would just require adding a `String` to the `failure` constructor -/
